# Workshop 10: Templates

* Version 1.0

Implement two function templates in C++ that work together to select and display elements from an array.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this workshop, you will have demonstrated the abilities to:

- Create a function template
- Create a function template with multiple typenames
- Create a function template module


## Submission Policy

The workshop is divided into one coding part and one non-coding part:

- Part 1 (**LAB**): A step-by-step guided workshop, worth 100% of the workshop's total mark
> Please note that the part 1 section is **not to be started in your first session of the week**. You should start it on your own before the day of your class and join the first session of the week to ask for help and correct your mistakes (if there are any).
- Part 2 (reflection): non-coding part. The reflection doesn't have marks associated with it but can incur a **penalty of max 40% of the whole workshop's mark** if your professor deems it insufficient (you make your marks from the code, but you can lose some on the reflection).

## Due Dates

The Due dates depend on your section. Please choose the "-due" option of the submitter program to see the exact due date of your section:

```bash
~profname.proflastname/submit 2??/wX/pY_sss -due<ENTER>
```
- Replace **??** with your subject code (`00 or 44`)
- Replace **X** with Workshop number: [`1 to 10`]
- Replace **Y** with the part number: [`1 or 2`]
- Replace **sss** with the section: [`naa, nbb, nra, zaa, etc...`]

## Late penalties
You are allowed to submit your work up to 2 days after the due date with a 30% penalty for each day. After that, the submission will be closed and the mark will be zero.

## Citation

Every file that you submit must contain (as a comment) at the top:<br />
**your name**, **your Seneca email**, **Seneca Student ID** and the **date** when you completed the work.

### For work that is done entirely by you (ONLY YOU)

If the file contains only your work or the work provided to you by your professor, add the following message as a comment at the top of the file:

> I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

### For work that is done partially by you.

If the file contains work that is not yours (you found it online or somebody provided it to you), **write exactly which part of the assignment is given to you as help, who gave it to you, or which source you received it from.**  By doing this you will only lose the mark for the parts you got help for, and the person helping you will be clear of any wrongdoing.

> - Add the citation to the file in which you have the borrowed code
> - In the 'reflect.txt` submission of part 2 (DIY), add exactly what is added to which file and from where (or whom).

> :warning: This [Submission Policy](#submission-policy) only applies to the workshops. All other assessments in this subject have their own submission policies.

### If you have helped someone with your code

If you have helped someone with your code. Let them know of these regulations and in your 'reflect.txt' of part 2 (DIY), write exactly which part of your code was copied and who was the recipient of this code.<br />By doing this you will be clear of any wrongdoing if the recipient of the code does not honour these regulations.

## Compiling and Testing Your Program

All your code should be compiled using this command on `matrix`:

```bash
g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -g -o ws file1.cpp file2.cpp ...
```

- `-Wall`: the compiler will report all warnings
- `-std=c++11`: the code will be compiled using the C++11 standard
- `-g`: the executable file will contain debugging symbols, allowing *valgrind* to create better reports
- `-o ws`: the compiled application will be named `ws`

After compiling and testing your code, run your program as follows to check for possible memory leaks (assuming your executable name is `ws`):

```bash
valgrind --show-error-list=yes --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes ws
```

- `--show-error-list=yes`: show the list of detected errors
- `--leak-check=full`: check for all types of memory problems
- `--show-leak-kinds=all`: show all types of memory leaks identified (enabled by the previous flag)
- `--track-origins=yes`: tracks the origin of uninitialized values (`g++` must use `-g` flag for compilation, so the information displayed here is meaningful).

To check the output, use a program that can compare text files.  Search online for such a program for your platform, or use *diff* available on `matrix`.

> Note: All the code written in workshops and the project must be implemented in the **sdds** namespace, unless instructed otherwise.

### Custom code submission

If you have any additional custom code, (i.e. functions, classes etc) that you want to reuse in the workshop save them under a module called Utils (`Utils.cpp and Utils.h`) and submit them with your workshop using the instructions in the "[Submitting Utils Module](#submitting-utils-module)" section.


> Note: All the code written in workshops and the project must be implemented in the **sdds** namespace.

# Part 1 - LAB (100%)

Study and understand all the modules given in this workshop and then:

Implement two function templates in C++ that work together to select  and display elements from an array based on a specified key (using operator==). These templates should be defined within a module named "selection".

### Function 1: `select`
**Purpose**: Create a function template named `select` within the `selection` module that searches an array for all occurrences of a specified key and returns a pointer to a new array containing the indices of these occurrences.

**Parameters**:
- `array[]`: An array of type `arrayType`
- `key`: The value to search for within the array of type `keyType`
- `size`: The size of the array of type `size_t`

**Return Value**: A pointer to a dynamically allocated array of `int` containing the indices where `key` is found in `array[]`. The last element of this array must be `-1` to indicate the end of the indices.

**Constraints**:
- Ensure the returned dynamic array size reflects the number of found keys plus one for the terminator `-1`.
- Use Constrained Casts where appropriate to store the indices in the returned array (if needed).
- Manage memory properly to avoid leaks.

### Function 2: `csvDisplaySelection`
**Purpose**: Create a function template named `csvDisplaySelection` within the `selection` module that takes a title and an array and displays the elements at the indices specified in a second array, formatted as a comma-separated list.

**Parameters**:
- `title`: A C-style string to be displayed before the list
- `array[]`: An array of type `arrayType` whose elements will be displayed
- `indices`: A pointer to an array of `int` containing the indices to be displayed from `array[]`

**Behavior**: If `indices` is not null and points to a valid array of indices, display the elements at those indices, separated by commas. If `indices` is null or points to an empty selection, display `"Empty Selection"`.

**Constraints**:
- Do not alter the signatures of the provided function templates.
- Ensure proper output formatting as per the given purpose of each function.
- The function templates must be contained within a module named "selection".

## Submission Requirements
- Have the `selection` module contain the `select` and `csvDisplaySelection` templates.
- Ensure your code is well-commented and also explain the logic and functionality of the functions in the part 2 refelection.

### Data Entry

No data entry needed

### Submission Process:

Upload the files listed above to your `matrix` account. Compile and run your code using the `g++` compiler as shown in [Compiling and Testing Your Program](#compiling-and-testing-your-program) and make sure that everything works properly.

Then, run the following command from your account
- replace `profname.proflastname` with your professor’s Seneca userid
- replace **??** with your subject code (2**00** or 2**44**)
- replace **#** with the workshop number
- replace **X** with the workshop part number (**1** or **2**) 
```text
~profname.proflastname/submit 2??/w#/pX
```
and follow the instructions.

#### Submitting Utils Module
To have your custom Utils module compiled with your workshop and submitted, add a **u** to the part number of your workshop (i.e **u**p1 for part one and **u**p2 for part two) and issue the following submission command instead of the above:
```text
~profname.proflastname/submit 2??/w#/upX
```
See [Custom Code Submission](#custom-code-submission) section for more detail

> **⚠️Important:** Please note that a successful submission does not guarantee full credit for this workshop. If the professor is not satisfied with your implementation, your professor may ask you to resubmit. Re-submissions will attract a penalty.


# Part 2: Reflection

Study your final solutions for each deliverable of the workshop **and the most recent milestones of the project**, reread the related parts of the course notes, and make sure that you have understood the concepts covered by this workshop.  **This should take no less than 30 minutes of your time and the result is suggested to be at least 150 words in length.**

Create a file named `reflect.txt` that contains your detailed description of the topics that you have learned in completing this workshop and **the project milestones** and mention any issues that caused you difficulty.


### Reflection Submission Process (Part 2):

Upload the files listed above to your `matrix` account. Compile and run your code using the `g++` compiler as shown in [Compiling and Testing Your Program](#compiling-and-testing-your-program) and make sure that everything works properly.

Then, run the following command from your matrix account

```bash
~profname.proflastname/submit 2??/wX/pY_sss  <ENTER>
```
- Replace **??** with your subject code (`00 or 44`)
- Replace **X** with Workshop number: [`1 to 10`]
- Replace **Y** with the part number: [`1 or 2`]
- Replace **sss** with the section: [`naa, nbb, nra, zaa, etc...`]

and follow the instructions.

> **⚠️Important:** Please note that a successful submission does not guarantee full credit for this workshop. If the professor is not satisfied with your implementation, your professor may ask you to resubmit. Re-submissions will attract a penalty.
