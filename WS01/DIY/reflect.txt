While writing this code, I learned about the use of ifstream to read the contents of a file in C++. I also learned about the use of strtok to tokenize a string based on a delimiter. Additionally, I learned about the importance of using _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS to suppress warnings related to the use of certain functions in C++. Overall, this code helped me improve my understanding of C++ programming and file input/output operations.
